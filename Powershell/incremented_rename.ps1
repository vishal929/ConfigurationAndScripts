# This is a script to help manage show files after dumping disks
# basically in a Season Directory we might have inconsistent filenames
# this script takes as input a basename i.e "S01".
# then this sorts all the files in the directory by time modified (assuming that the write time is consistent with the actual episode order)
# then the files in the directory are renamed something like "S01-E01", "S01-E02", and so on...
